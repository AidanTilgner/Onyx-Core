# Onyx Core Speech

This is only an interface for the Onyx Speech server. The Speech server has been extracted out and exists as its own project. This is to allow for the speech server to have a higher degree of flexibility than other Onyx components. For example, it's written in python, which allows for easier development and deployment with the speech functionality.
